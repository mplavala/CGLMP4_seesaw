# See-saw maximization of the CGLMP<sub>4</sub> contextuality inequality

Contents:

- `seesaw.py`: Python code that performs the optimization. See-saw is performed `N` times, by default ` N = 10000` is set.
- `results-N-10000-I_4-0.336085803661498.npy` data from running the see-saw optimization 10 000 times with highest violation of 0.336085803661498.
- `results-N-100-I_4-0.33606808585730574.npy` data from running the see-saw optimization 100 times with highest violation of 0.33606808585730574.
- `results-N-10-I_4-0.3360675301596743.npy` data from running the see-saw optimization 10 times with highest violation of 0.3360675301596743.
